The nifi-web-api-0.7.1.jar file in this directory is a modified version of the NiFi web API.
The REST end-points have not been altered, but the method on line 742:

org.apache.nifi.web.api.ProcessGroupResource.getProcessGroup(ClientIdParameter, String, Boolean, Boolean)

has been renamed to:

org.apache.nifi.web.api.ProcessGroupResource.getProcessGroupReference(ClientIdParameter, String, Boolean, Boolean)

to better reflect its purpose and avoid a name-clash.

This results in a file that is not functionally any different, but better suits the needs of code generation.
