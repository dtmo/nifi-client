The nifi-web-api-1.1.2.jar file in this directory is a modified version of the NiFi web API.
The REST end-points have not been altered, but the ApiOperation annotation on the method:

org.apache.nifi.web.api.ProcessGroupResource.getProcessGroups

has been changed to report the correct response type (ProcessGroupsEntity)

This results in a file that is not functionally any different, but better suits the needs of code generation.
